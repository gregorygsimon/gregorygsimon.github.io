	<p> Our primary metric of success is our Course Completion Rate (CCR). All students in our department use the same virtual textbook, have access to the same resources, so the difference in my CCR is based on how I outreach to students. With our KPI reports in through January 2020, this completes over <b> 6 months running where my Course Completion Rate has been higher than our team goal and significantly higher than our department overall</b>.   </p>

	<p> There is no doubt in my mind that the reason is <i> better data</i> and <i> better use of data</i>. Our WGU students work at their own pace through the material. By using Python to gather students data quickly from various sources, I am able to identify  which students are doing well and (more importantly) which students could benefit most from my help. So while colleagues are spending a lot of their efforts in broad general messaging to their students, I am able to use Python to personalize interactions with students and better predict who needs my help.</p>

        <p> Our other major metric is our Non-Attempt Rate (NAR) which measures the percent of students who do not make it to the final assessment within their term limit. This has a major impact on Course Completion Rate since students who do not make it to the test in time automatically do not complete the course. I have been significantly better than our team average in NAR with 10% NAR compared to 15% overall over the past 6 months.</p>

        <p> This again highlights the value of personalized, just-in-time outreach. If you can help students exactly when they start to fall off course, then you can keep them on pace at a much higher rate. This is only possible with data wrangling and analytics. Full data summary below:</p>
