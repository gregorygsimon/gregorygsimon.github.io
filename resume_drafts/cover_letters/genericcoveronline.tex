\opening{Dear Hiring Committee,}

I am writing to apply for your Junior Data Scientist position.
%who are you?
I am a Ph.D graduate in mathematics from the University of Michigan, currently
pursuing an additional Masters degree in Data Analytics (expected March 2021). I
have spent the last three years as a statistics faculty member at Western
Governors University (WGU). 

% what are your specific research/teaching interests?
At WGU, my team of 10 colleagues were responsible for
supporting approximately 1500 active students in our statistics course at any
given time. I used my software engineering skills in Python to gather, analyze, visualize, and derive
actionable insights from our student data. These efforts
increased course completion rates from 82\% baseline to 88\% while conservatively
saving multiple hours per week for each member of our team of 10 faculty members utilizing my
automation services and student data dashboard.

%tell them what application materials you have submitted and where
%say who wrote your recs

I believe in producing demonstable, measurable value. I have completed numerous
other successful value-driven projects outside of my work with WGU.
Please see my project portfolio at \url{https://gregorygsimon.github.io}  for

I would love to bring my passion, knowledge, ability, and enthusiasm to your
team to help you solve your business challenges. Thank you for your consideration.
