\opening{Dear Hiring Committee,}
I am writing to apply for your Data Scientist position.
I am a Ph.D graduate in mathematics from the University of Michigan, currently
pursuing an additional Masters degree in Data Analytics (expected March 2021). I
have spent the last three years as a statistics faculty member at Western
Governors University (WGU). 

At WGU, my team of 10 colleagues were responsible for
supporting approximately 1500 active students in our statistics course at any
given time. I used my software engineering skills (primarily Python, R, and SQL) to gather, analyze, visualize, and derive
actionable insights from our student data. These efforts
increased course completion rates from 82\% baseline to 88\% while conservatively
saving multiple hours per week for each member of our team of 10 faculty members utilizing my
automation services and student data dashboard.

I believe in producing demonstrable, measurable value. I have completed numerous
other successful, value-driven data science projects outside of my work with WGU.
Please see my project portfolio at \url{https://gregorygsimon.github.io}  for
more.

I would love to bring my passion, knowledge, ability, and enthusiasm to your
team to help you solve your business challenges. Thank you for your consideration.
