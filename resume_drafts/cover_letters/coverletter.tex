\opening{Hello!}

I am extremely excited to apply to work for Upstart. I think you are exactly
what I have been looking for, and I wonder if I am exactly what {\sl you} are
looking for as well. Much of my work with Bayer the last year or so has been
focused on modeling financial risk, especially regarding large-dimensional,
highly-correlated assets and using atypical data. My PhD in mathematics
from a top school in the field has made me especially equipped at handling the
nuanced quantitative modeling required, including learning and adapting new
methodologies (e.g. from econometrics) that are outside of the typical data science or machine learning repertoire.

\bigskip

Ultimately I am looking for a position with a
company that is modern and data driven. The world of financial risk modeling and
customer decision modeling is where I want to be. I think Upstart is
exactly what I am looking for. I am applying to both
your open Senior Data Scientist position as well as your Research Scientist
position as I think both roles would be an excellent fit.

\bigskip

I would love to bring my enthusiasm, expertise, ability, and drive to your
team to help you deliver value to your customers. Thank you so much for your
time and consideration.


\closing{Sincerely,
