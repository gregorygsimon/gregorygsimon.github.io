\opening{Dear Sir or Madame:}

I am extremely excited to apply to work for Netflix. Much of my work with
General Motors and previously with Bayer Crop Science has been focused on
different versions of the problem: {\sl who} wants {\sl what}.

Most recently, this took the form of a conversational sales assistant
focused on integrating ChatGPT and document embedding models into the task of
recommending vehcile inventory and asking optimal follow-up questions.

I have extensive experience in recommendation systems, sales forecasting, choice
modeling, correlated risk modeling, and pricing. The common pattern in all of
these projects is rigorous quantitative validation. In all of my projects, I
have championed a rigorous, scientific approach to proving our methods.

One of the most challenging tasks for junior scientists is to take a business
problem and to formulate it into a quantitative challenge - to make sure our
target metrics align precisely with business objectives. When I lead a team, I
have found that defining that quantitive challenge aligns us to a common aim,
and gives the structure that my teammates' need to let their creativity and
expertise shine.

So as the job description mentions {\sl driving product innovation through
  robust measurement strategies across experimentation}, I think I could be a
great fit.

I would love to bring my enthusiasm, expertise, ability, and drive to your
team to help you deliver proven value to your customers. Thank you so much for your
time and consideration.
