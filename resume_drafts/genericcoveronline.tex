I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign under
the direction of C. Ward Henson. I expect to complete my degree in May of 2009.

%what are your specific research/teaching interests?
My research interests include continuous logic
and its application to metric structures from analysis and geometry.
My thesis work is on the model theory of $\R$-trees, which are
metric spaces of central importance in geometric group theory.
I am currently finishing a paper 
with my advisor, and
expect at least one more paper to result from the contents of my thesis.
I am also committed to being an effective, engaging teacher.
While at Illinois I worked hard to
develop my teaching skills, teaching in various formats and earning
a graduate teacher certificate. 
%here you could play up either teaching or research and mention highlights of your
%CV, I also used it to say something about papers, since I hadn't published any
% to put on my CV

%tell them what application materials you have submitted and where
%say who wrote your recs
Attached you will find my curriculum vitae and research statement.
