        <h4> Business use-case </h4>
	      <p> At WGU, students work asynchronously, proceeding through each course at their own pace.
            Faculty outreach to struggling students to help them along their way.
            An outside vendor (MindEdge.com) hosts our online textbook, and accessing this site to get all relevant student data takes 32 mouse-clicks and about 6 minutes.
            If a faculty member tries to engage with 10-15 students individually in a work day, it is not currently feasible to check their progress.
        </p>

        <p> By accessing MindEdge's API, this dashboard reduces the number of clicks to 1 and reduces the time down to about 20 seconds.
            This empowers the faculty member with the ability to see their student's progress at a glance in all Modules/Chapters.
            So the faculty members can instantly differentiate students who need support vs. who don't, as well as seeing where the student is in the course.
        </p>

        <h4> Results </h4>

        <div style="margin: 0 auto;width:1200px;">
	          <img
	              src="images/dashboard_ex1.png" width="750" alt=""
	          />
	      </div>

        <p> The dashboard above tells an immediate story: this student needs help!
            <ul>
                <li> The <i> Completion </i> graph shows they are through everything but the end of Ch.7. </li>
                <li> The <i>Quiz Results</i> show strong scores through Ch.5 but all over a month ago. We want students to complete each chapter in under 2 weeks. </li>
                <li> The <i>Hours Engaged</i> graph shows sporadic engagement over the last 5 months, especially low in the last few weeks. Quite common in the covid era for schoolwork to take a backseat.</li>

            </ul>
            This is student exhibits an extreme case of a common phenomenon: students get stuck in Ch.7 since it deals with challenging Bayesian probability ideas.
            This student needs outreach, and an invitation to come in to office hours!
        </p>

        <p> Compare that with the student below, who we can instantly see is making great progress and doesn't need require any intervention:</p>

        <div style="margin: 0 auto;width:1200px;">
	          <img
	              src="images/dashboard_ex2.png" width="750" alt=""
	          />
	      </div>


        <p> The code for this project is available as <a href="https://github.com/gregorygsimon/gregorygsimon.github.io/blob/master/student_dashboard_prototype.py"> student_dashboard_prototype.py </a>.
            Some elements were removed from this prototype (like student name, email, ID number, student notes, etc.) to protect students privacy and maintain FERPA compliance.
