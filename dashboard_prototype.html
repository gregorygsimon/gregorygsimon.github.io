        <h4> Business use-case </h4>
	      <p> At WGU, students work asynchronously, proceeding through each course at their own pace.
            Faculty outreach to struggling students to help them along their way.
            An outside vendor (MindEdge.com) hosts our online textbook, and accessing this site to get all relevant student data takes 32 mouse-clicks and about 6 minutes.
            If a faculty member tries to engage with 10-15 students individually in a work day, it is not currently feasible to check their progress.
        </p>

        <p> By accessing MindEdge's API, this dashboard reduces the number of clicks to 1 and reduces the time down to about 20 seconds.
            This empowers the faculty member with the ability to see their student's progress at a glance in all Modules/Chapters.
            So the faculty members can instantly differentiate students who need support vs. who don't, as well as seeing where the student is in the course.
        </p>
