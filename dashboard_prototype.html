        <h4> Business use-case </h4>
	      <p> At WGU, students work asynchronously, proceeding through each course at their own pace.
            Faculty outreach to struggling students to help them along their way.
            An outside vendor (MindEdge.com) hosts our online textbook, and accessing this site to get all relevant student data takes 22 mouse-clicks and about 4 minutes
            (having to click into each quiz result in each Chapter is a big part of this).
            If a faculty member tries to engage with 20-25 students individually in a work day, it is not currently feasible to check on their progress.
        </p>

        <p> By accessing MindEdge's API, this dashboard reduces the number of clicks to 1 and reduces the time down to about 20 seconds.
            This empowers the faculty member with the ability to see their student's progress at a glance in all Chapters.
            So the faculty members can instantly differentiate students who need support vs. who don't, as well as seeing where the student is in the course.
        </p>

        <h4> Results </h4>

        <div style="margin: 0 auto;width:1200px;">
	          <img
	              src="images/dashboard_ex1.png" width="750" alt=""
	          />
	      </div>

        <p> The dashboard above (created Sep 21) tells an immediate story: this student needs help!
            <ul>
                <li> The <i> Completion </i> graph shows they are through everything but the end of Ch.7. </li>
                <li> The <i>Quiz Results</i> show strong scores through Ch.5 but all over a month ago. We want students to complete each chapter in under 2 weeks. </li>
                <li> The <i>Hours Engaged</i> graph shows sporadic engagement over the last 5 months, especially low in the last few weeks. Quite common in the covid era for schoolwork to take a backseat.</li>

            </ul>
            This is student exhibits an extreme case of a common phenomenon: students get stuck in Ch.7 since it deals with challenging Bayesian probability ideas.
            This student needs outreach, and an invitation to come in to office hours!
        </p>

        <p> Compare that with the student below, who we can instantly see is just starting out but has made great progress (about one Chapter per week) with solid quiz scores.
            This student does not require any intervention:</p>

        <div style="margin: 0 auto;width:1200px;">
	          <img
	              src="images/dashboard_ex3.png" width="750" alt=""
	          />
	      </div> <br>

        <h4> Conclusion </h4>

        <p>
            This dashboard prototype has the potential to revolutionize how WGU faculty monitor their students' asychronous progress.
            It would provide benefit to all stakeholders.
        <ul>
            <li> <i>On-time Course Completion</i> is the KPI with greatest impetus for improvement. This dashboard can empower faculty to identify and intervene with the students who are at risk of falling behind.</li>
                <li> Students would receive more relevant and personalized outreach from faculty.</li>
                <li> Faculty would save time clicking through a slow website interface, and save time by identifying students who do not need any intervention.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        

        <h4> Code </h4>

        <p> The code for this project is available as
            <a href="https://github.com/gregorygsimon/gregorygsimon.github.io/blob/master/student_dashboard_prototype.py"> student_dashboard_prototype.py </a>,
            which is available below.
            Some elements were removed from this prototype (like student name, email, ID number, student notes, etc.) to protect students privacy and maintain FERPA compliance.
            I will highlight a few implementation decisions.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li> The <code> sharey='row' </code> option in <code>plt.subplots()</code> is extremely helpful to visually align the 7 chapters. </li>
            <li> Similary <code> ax.invert_yaxis() </code> makes the Chapters read downwards from 1 to 7. </li>
            <li> The colormap <code> cmap=plt.cm.viridis_r </code> is excellent to differentiate hot/current yellow quiz results from colder/old purple quiz results. </li>
            <li> We reduce opacity and add some small horizontal random jitter to the quiz result circles<br> via <code> quiz_df['Percent'].apply(lambda x: x+np.random.normal(0,0.1)) </code> <br> Otherwise multiple identical scores would be invisible as they would overlap completely. </li>
        </ul>
