	<h3> Summary </h3>
	<p> When students completed a practice test, our faculty team
	had each been emailing individual students a templated email on recommended next
	steps based on how they did, and adding a note to their
	student record. I automated this for my team using a daily
	Python script that involved SQL querying our student database,
	processing the data in Python/pandas, emailing students
	customized messages with pywin32, and using selenium to
	automate the note writing process. </p>
	
	<h3> Details </h3>
	
	<p><img

	WGU uses a variant of Salesforce for our student
	records, which we access using the <a
	href="https://pypi.org/project/simple-salesforce/">
	simple salesforce </a> package. Once initiated, queries were
	done with queries in a dialect of SQL.</p>


	<p> I'm going to present a simplified version of the
	queries and code below. This will demonstrate the methodology without
	revealing the database architecture of WGU. I'll also only
	provide the interesting key components here.</p>

	<br>

	<h4> Querying the database </h4>

	<p> We want to gather all recent Preassessment
	attempts, then use the list of id numbers to count how many
	total attempts each user has attempted so far, send anyone not
	yet notified a customized email based on their results and number of
	attempts, timezone, etc., note the outreach in their student
	record, and log the resulting dataframe in a spreadsheet (used
	to verify if they have been notified already). </p>
	<p>

<pre><code class="language-python">
    sf = Salesforce(instance='srm.my.salesforce.com', session_id=session_id)
    
    # n is the number of days to search for new assessment results
    # str_start is the string defining the left bound for searching dates 
    str_start = (datetime.now() + timedelta(days=-n)).date().isoformat()
        
    sqlstring = """SELECT 
    StudentRecord__r.CourseNumber__c,
    ExamScore__c,
    StudentRecord__r.Contact__r.FirstName,
    StudentRecord__r.Contact__r.Email,
    StudentRecord__r.Contact__r.Timezone__c,
    FROM 
    StudentExamAttempt__c
    WHERE 
    ( StudentExamAttempt__r.Course__c = 'C784' 
     OR StudentExamAttempt__r.CourseCode__c = 'L121')
     AND (Date__c >= {0}T00:00:00-07:00 OR Created >= {0}T00:00:00-07:00)
     AND Score__c != 'NOT ATTEMPTED'
    """.format(str_start)
    
    records = (sf.query(sqlstring))['records']
</code></pre></p>

	<p> The records come in the form of a Python dictionary. We
	create a new dictionary named <code class="language-python">
	rows </code> which flattens and simplifies the returns of the
	SQL query via Python. Then initialize a DataFrame with <code
	class="language-python"> df = pd.DataFrame(rows) </code>
	</p>

	<p> This gives us a list of recent Preassessment
	attempts. Since we want to send a different message if they've
	taken this test more than once, we need to search for all
	Preassessment attempts for the ID numbers we've gathered so
	far. Then pandas' <code class="language-python">
	df.groupby('id').count() </code> gives us a beautiful one-line
	way to count total number of Preassessment attempts after
	querying for all Preassessment attempts matching the IDs found
	in the previous query. </p>

	<pre><code class="language-python">def countpas(ids,session_id):
    """takes a list of id number strings and session_id for Salesforce access
    returns DF counting number of PAs attempted"""
    # join list of strings to a single string formatted for SQL
    ids_str = "('"+ ( "','".join(ids) ) + "')"

    sqlstring = """
    SELECT AssessmentCode__c, StudentRecord__r.Contact__r.ID__c
    FROM 
    StudentRecord__c 
    WHERE 
    StudentRecord__r.Contact__r.ID__c IN {0} 
    AND
    AssessmentCode__c IN ('PAQO', 'PQQC')
    LIMIT 1000
    """.format(ids_str)
    
    sf = Salesforce(instance='srm.my.salesforce.com', session_id=session_id)
    records = (sf.query(sqlstring))['records']

    # flatten the dictionary returned
    rows = []
    for rec in records:
        row={}
        row['code'] = rec['AssessmentCode__c']
        row['id'] = rec['StudentRecord__r']['Contact__r']['ID__c']
        rows.append(row)

    df = pd.DataFrame(rows)
    df = df.groupby('id').count()
    df.columns = ['count']
	return df </code> </pre>

	<br>

<h4> Sending emails </h4>

<p> Next in the pipeline is <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pywin32/"> pywin32 </a>
specifically the <code class="language-python"> win32com.client</code>
to send customized emails. I use <code class="language-python">
os.getcwd() </code> as this was designed to be portable to other
systems if needed. Here is a trimmed down example of how to write an
email with pywin32: </p>

<pre> <code class="language-python">import win32com.client as win32

outlook = win32.Dispatch('outlook.application')
# emailTemplate points to one of several .ost Outlook email templates
# defined previously based on how they did, how many tries it took, etc.
mail = outlook.CreateItemFromTemplate(
   os.getcwd()+'\\'+emailTemplate
)

# how to set attributes of the email,
# including customizing based on timezone
mail.To = row['email']+'@wgu.edu'
mail.SentOnBehalfOfName = 'healthstats@wgu.edu'
mail.Subject = subject
mail.HtmlBody = mail.HtmlBody.replace("AvailableHours",hours[row['timezone']])

mail.Send()
</code> </pre>

<br>

<h4> Automated form filling </h4>

<p> As an institution where students work at their own pace, WGU is
required to document substantive student interaction with faculty, as
too little interaction from students would jeopardize its
accreditation.

This is done within Salesforce, but modifying records using python
could lead to problems. Instead, we use <a
href="https://www.seleniumhq.org/"> 
selenium </a> to automate a chrome browser to manually enter the
information one student at a time.</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys

#available at selenium website
wd = webdriver.Chrome(os.getcwd()+"\\chromedriver.exe")

def getel(css_string):
    #a shorter alias to get elements based on css selector string
    global wd
    return wd.find_element_by_css_selector(css_string)

def typein(element,text):
    # entering long text one key press at a time using selenium
    # is significantly slower than using the clipboard
    initialClip = pyperclip.paste()
    pyperclip.copy(str(text))
    element.clear()
    element.send_keys(Keys.CONTROL,'v')
    pyperclip.copy(initialClip)
</code></pre>

<p> With <code class="language-python"> loginLink </code> defined to be the address to the login
page, and after finding the CSS selector names for the username and
password text input elements on the page, we can use these functions
to log-in to the system. </p>

<pre><code class="language-python">wd.get(loginLink)
getel("#login-username").clear()
typein(getel("#login-username"),"greg.simon")
getel("#login-password").clear()
typein(getel("#login-password"),userInput)
getel("#login-password").send_keys(Keys.ENTER)
</code></pre>

<p> The code to enter the student note and information is very similar but
takes quite a bit of careful CSS selection to navigate to the right place,
enter the custom note based on the situation, and make sure AJAX on
the page loads properly. </p>

<h4> Logging results </h4>

<p> We close with the code to log the resulting data frame as a way to
verify what students were already emailed (to prevent double emailing)
as well as for bug catching. Pandas has brilliant support for writing
and reading Excel spreasheets. </p>

<pre><code class="language-python">def logResults(df):
    timestring = datetime.now().strftime("%m-%d-%H_%M_%S")

    writer = pd.ExcelWriter(
        os.getcwd()+'\\PreassessmentNotifications\\logs\\PAData'+timestring+'.xlsx',
        engine='xlsxwriter'
    )

    df.to_excel(writer,'Sheet1')
</code></pre>

<br>

<p> When the queries are made, this most recent Excel log is loaded as the <code
class="language-python"> df_old </code>, which we apply a function to
and use a boolean mask to select records only from the last week, to be merged with the most
recently pulled data, and duplicate entries dropped. This serves two
purposes: we don't email the same person twice about the same
Preassessment, and we don't email the same person at all within 7
days, which was a decision we made as a team. </p>
  
<pre><code class="language-python">
def withinLastWeek(MDHM):
   # given string of form '%m-%d %H:%M', returns True if date is within last week
   year_week_ago = (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7)).year
   delta = datetime.now() - datetime.strptime(str(year_week_ago)+'-'+MDHM,'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')
   return (delta.days < 7)

bool_recent = df_old['updated'].apply(withinLastWeek)

df_old_recent = dfold[bool_recent]
df_merged = pd.concat([df_old_recent,df_new])
df_merged['id'] = dfmerged['id'].apply(str)

#if row already exists, keep original row only
df_cleaned = df_merged.drop_duplicates(['pidm'],keep='first')
df_cleaned.reset_index(inplace=True,drop=True)
</code></pre>

<br>

<h3> What did I learn? </h3>

<p> A lot! This was the largest project I had undertaken so far
utilizing many packages and skills to create a full automation
pipeline for a complicated series of steps. This project demonstrates
the versatility of python, and the elegance and power of pandas for data gathering, cleaning, and analyzing.
</p>
<p> This code has run successfully for several years. It conservatively saved about 15 minutes per work day for each of my dozen
Ph.D. teammates, while sending a more personalized and customized
email of recommendations, and sending it quicker. My
teammates were and continue to be ecstatic about this and other
automation help I've been able to create. </p>
